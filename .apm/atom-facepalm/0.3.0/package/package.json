Try harder!\n\n![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/varyform/atom-facepalm/master/screenshots/static.png)\n\n## Configuration\n\nOut of the box, Atom will consider *all* of your code facepalm-worthy. However, by changing a setting, you can make Atom\nonly facepalm when it's *really* bad.\n\nIf you specify one or more \"Activation Events\", each time one of the named events is emitted, the facepalm will be\ninvoked. Similarly, when one of the \"Deactivation Events\" is received, the facepalm will go away. For example, to\nfacepalm when your tests are failing, install [Tom Bell's excellent test-status\npackage](https://atom.io/packages/test-status), and specify the following settings for Facepalm:\n\n * **Activation Events:** `test-status:fail`\n * **Deactivation Events:** `test-status:success`\n\n![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/varyform/atom-facepalm/master/screenshots/dynamic.gif)\n\n## Contributors\n* [smashwilson](https://github.com/smashwilson) / [Ash Wilson](http://azurefire.net/) â€“ Contextual facepalming.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/varyform/atom-facepalm/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/varyform/atom-facepalm#readme","_id":"atom-facepalm@0.3.0","_shasum":"0e6a123b997a5fbe67e2bf564034ff526ffdecdc","_resolved":"file:../d-117412-11985-ziq4vg/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117412-11985-ziq4vg/package.tgz"}
