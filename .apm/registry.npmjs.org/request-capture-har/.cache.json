Instead of monkey-patching `request-promise`, the API allows you to pass in the general `request` module. We also added better support for transfer timings.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/39191/18031306/9401070c-6c8f-11e6-994d-03e6b8b511e4.png)\n_Above is a HAR captured by using `request-capture-har` from within `npm` to capture an `npm install`._\n\n### Background\nThis is especially useful for capturing all test traffic from your back-end test suite, for doing auto mocking in your front-end test suite. See this project for an example: https://github.com/larsthorup/http-auto-mock-demo.
