Fully ES6!\nLess typing more coding!\n\n# Note:\nThis is a fork of `atom-es6-javascript` by @hharnisc which in turn was a fork of `turbo-javascript` by @extrabacon.\n~~The only reason for forking this wonderful project was the difference in styling between me and the original author.\nNamely I prefer single quotes and no space between function and parentheses. That's it~~.\n\nI feel like I have made enough changes to this project (and I will continue to add more and more) so to call it \"just a fork\", in my opinion isn't justified anymore.\n\n\n## License\n[MIT](LICENSE.md) Â© [Pomba Magar](https://github.com/PombaM)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"Quick-JavaScript@2.2.0","_shasum":"2e90897cc4d918d938aee775b30673bcc23da05e","_resolved":"file:../d-117310-17774-1tyfxuj/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117310-17774-1tyfxuj/package.tgz"}
